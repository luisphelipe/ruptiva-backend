#TODO

books crud (
- book model (book title, image_url?, review?, rating?)
- user has many books
- controller with:
  - list
  - create (+vaidator)
  - get (just for completness)
  - edit
  - delete

book factory -> create user if no userId were passed.

V2
use https://isbndb.com/apidocs/v2 to get book data.

Final vision:
something like https://letterboxd.com/ but for books.
...that's https://www.goodreads.com/ I guess

#DONE

- user model
signup/login
- user signup (route, controller, validation)
- user login (route, controller, simpler validation)
